A simple API wrapper for [Mangadex](https://mangadex.org) written in python. This is an ongoing project so **not all features have been implemented** and due to mangadex v5 still being in development procedures may change and the code **may get depricated at any time**.

> This API wrapper does not provide each little detail seperately, so the user has to get and manage data returned by the functions.
